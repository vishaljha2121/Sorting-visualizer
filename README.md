# Sorting-visualizer
This is a progressive web app built using React and is used to visualize classic algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heap sort.

# Purpose
To improve my skills with react and also learn classic sorting algorithms, I crated this project and it turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.

# App conventions
The src folder contains two subdirectories:
 sortingAlgorithms : It contains a helper folder with multi-use functions used in the main file sortingAlgorithms.js  which contains three sorting algorithms.
