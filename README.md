# Sorting Visualizer

This is a progressive web app built using React and is used to visualize classic algorithms such as merge sort, quick sort and heap sort.

  

## Purpose

To improve my skills with react and also learn classic sorting algorithms, I crated this project and it turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.

  

## App conventions

The src folder contains two subdirectories:

 - *sortingAlgorithms* : It contains a helper folder with multi-use functions used in the main file sortingAlgorithms.js which contains three sorting algorithms.
 - sortingVisualizer : It contains the core visualizer which visualizes the sorting algorithms using arrays in form of bars.
